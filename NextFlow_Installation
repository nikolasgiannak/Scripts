# STEP 1 		is TO INSTALL sdkman



# Launch a terminal window and type the following:

curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash


# After this, run the following, to initialise it:

 source "/Users/nikolaosgiannakis/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

# Check the version of it to see that everything has been installed properly
# if it shows  script and native then everything is alright



# STEP 2			is to install the Coretto and/ OR the Temurin

# These 2 are the recommended distress

# To install theme type the followingL:

sdk install java 17.0.6-amzn

sdk install jave 17.0.6-tem


# STEP 3 		TO INSTALL NextFlow

# In order to do that I need the wget command, Therefor I need to install wget


# I will install wget with brew, as follows: 

brew install wget

 #after this I install nextflow as follows:

wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# Last but not least, I put the executable file of nextflow on my $PATH

# 			HOW ?

# /Users/nikolaosgiannakis/nextflow is the complete file where I have the executable program
# /usr/local/bin is where I put it on the PATH
# Once I put the program on my PATH I can only write a single command aka nextflow instead of /Users/nikolaosgiannakis/nextflow

sudo ln -s /Users/nikolaosgiannakis/nextflow /usr/local/bin
