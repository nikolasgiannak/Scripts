# Steps to follow for Nextflow pipelines. 

# This is an exmple for an RNAseq pipeline but the same principles apply for all the pipelines.

# Nextflow pipelines need to be run interactively, in an interactive session on Eddie. 

# The pipeline will then submit jobs to the Eddie scheduler for you.

# The following steps need to be followed.

#  1. Login into eddie
                        ssh  ngiannak@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk

#  2. Start a screen session
                        [ngiannak@login01(eddie) ~]$ screen

# To inspect the presence of an active screen, DO THIS:
                        screen -ls

# 3. Once in the screen session, start a qlogin session with a good amount of virtual memory ( 32GB seems to work for this particular pipeline):
                        qlogin -l h_vmem=32G
